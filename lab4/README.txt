ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS

In theory, how large can N be before your program fails? What determines this limit?

The text of your prompt (“Please input a number:”) is stored in the processor’s memory. 
After assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which this string is stored?

Of the instructions you used, which were pseudo-ops (instructions that are not part of the MIPS instruction language, 
that were translated into other instructions by the assembler)? How do the assembled instructions produce the appropriate result?

How many registers did you use in writing this program? Could you have used fewer registers? 
Describe how, or explain why you cannot.
